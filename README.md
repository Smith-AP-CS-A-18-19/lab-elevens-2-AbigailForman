# Elevens 2

Follow the instructions provided for Activity 2 in the student lab guide. You will need to copy your completed `Card.java` file from Elevens 1 into this directory. If you were unable to complete that lab, you will need to get the code from another student. You have one week to complete this lab. Once you have completed the lab, be sure to commit and push your code in Atom.
